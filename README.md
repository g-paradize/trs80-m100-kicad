Schematic of TRS-80 Model 100
-----------------------------

This is a transcript of the original schematic found in the TRS-80 Model 80
manual. The scans to be found are somewhat hard to decipher.

This transcript in KiCAD attempts to preserve the original layout as much
as possible to easily navigate between the original and the transcript.

Work in progress, only a fraction has been transcribed yet (power supply
and reset section).
